# Exploring Energy Efficiency with Bokeh: A Tutorial

Welcome to this educational tutorial on using the Bokeh library for data visualizations! In this repository, we will embark on a journey to explore energy efficiency programs across U.S. states using interactive visualizations created with Bokeh.

## Objectives

1. **Investigate Energy Efficiency Trends**: Analyze the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs over time, visualizing patterns and highlighting successes and areas for improvement.

2. **Learn Bokeh**: Understand core concepts and features of the Bokeh library, progressing from simple to more complex and dynamic visualizations.

## Dataset

We will be working with data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), focusing on costs and savings from energy efficiency programs by state and sector. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the financial and efficiency aspects of energy-saving initiatives across the U.S.

## Visualization Techniques

Throughout this tutorial, we will employ various visualization techniques to uncover insights and tell a compelling story with our data:

- Line/Area Plots
- Bar Charts
- Chloropleth Maps

Each technique will be enhanced with interactivity using Bokeh to create engaging and dynamic visualizations.

## Getting Started

To follow along with the tutorial, you can either:

- Launch the notebook using Binder: [Binder Link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JewelsHovan/BokehDemo/0a1663591e3e104a785fda9af589d3d4365e389f?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FAssignment3.ipynb)
- Clone the repository and run the notebook locally: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JewelsHovan/BokehDemo)

Get ready to dive into the world of interactive data visualization with Bokeh and uncover insights into the U.S. energy landscape! I hope you learn skills to use in your own projects or to even extend the visualization I performed in my notebook!
